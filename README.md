# Codedex-Hackathon

This is the analysis of 2021 Tokyo Olympics data set. The whole data set used contains the data from the very beginning of Olympics but we only used Tokyo 2021 for visual analysis.


Predictive analysis uses the whole data set, starting from 1999 and shows if the team with a given description(Sport, Gender, Country Code) will receive a medal and what kind of medal.


The visual analysis uses a PowerPoint Presentation with audio annotations.
Tableau was used for visual generation.
